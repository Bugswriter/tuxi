### How does this work?

The script uses `pup` to scrape Google search results and SERPs.
If the query returns several results, Tuxi will choose the most 
relevant result on the basis of priority.

In addition to scraping, `tuxi` also uses `jq`, `awk` and `sed` 
to process and return results, and `recode` to unescape html.

## Requirements

* [pup](https://github.com/ericchiang/pup) - CLI tool for processing HTML.
* [recode](https://github.com/rrthomas/recode) - Charset converter tool and library.
* [jq](https://github.com/stedolan/jq) - Command-line JSON processor.

## Installation

### cURL
cURL **tuxi** to your **$PATH** and give execute permissions.

```sh
$ sudo curl -sL "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Bugswriter/tuxi/main/tuxi" -o /usr/local/bin/tuxi
$ sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/tuxi
```
> To update, just do `curl` again, no need to `chmod` anymore.  
> To uninstall, simply remove `tuxi` from your **$PATH**, for example `sudo rm -f /usr/local/bin/tuxi`.

### Make
```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/Bugswriter/tuxi.git && cd tuxi/
$ sudo make install
```
> To update, just `git pull` on your local tuxi repository and reinstall with `sudo make install`.  
> To uninstall, simply run `sudo make uninstall`.

### Arch Linux AUR
Tuxi is available as the [`tuxi-git`](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/tuxi-git/) package in the **AUR**.
```sh
$ yay -S tuxi-git
```

## Usage

```sh
$ tuxi "Is Linux better than Windows?"
---
Linux has a reputation for being fast and smooth while
Windows 10 is known to become slow and slow over
time. Linux runs faster than Windows 8.1 and Windows 10
along with a modern desktop environment and qualities of the
operating system while windows are slow on older hardware.
---
```
* Quotations are optional, but should be used if you want to search with special characters (?=!|&<>%$#/\\).
* You can also write your query as a statement, e.g: `tuxi linus torvalds birthday`.
* The -r option will make the output not have formatting, which can be convenient for use in scripts.
* The -q option silences "Did you mean?" and Tuxi's greeting on calling `tuxi`.

Use `-h` to display the help message.

```sh
$ tuxi -h
Usage: tuxi [options] query

Options:
  -h                    Show this help message and exit.
  -r                    Raw search results.
                        (no pretty output, no colors)
  -q                    Only output search results.
                        (silences "Did you mean?", greeting, usage)

## Features

**Easily change query language**
Line 7 in `tuxi` contains the language variable which can be changed according the user's preference.
However, tuxi will use the system default langauge if none is set.

**Gives corrections**
```sh
$ tuxi linux torvalds birthday
> Did you mean linus?
---
28 December 1969
---
```

**When you know it's actually linux torvalds** <kbd>-q option</kbd>
```sh
$ tuxi -q linux torvalds birthday
---
28 December 1969
---
```

**Raw formatting for output (no colors)** <kbd>-r option</kbd>
> Useful for e.g scripting `notify-send`.
```sh
$ tuxi -r linux torvalds birthday
> Did you mean linus?
28 December 1969
```

**Math operations**
```sh
$ tuxi "log(30)"
---
1.4771212547196624
---
```

**Translate**
```sh
$ tuxi "I love you in japanese"
---
わたしは、あなたを愛しています
---
$ tuxi "わたしは、あなたを愛しています in english"
---
I love you
---
```

**And much more (lyrics, weather, conversions...)**
